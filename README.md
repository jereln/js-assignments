#Javascript Playground

## Javascript Objects
###Sample Usage
```javascript
var test = new Hero('Batman', 'Brucewayne')

console.log(test.name); // "Batman"
console.log(test.revealIdentity()); // "Batman is Bruce Wayne"
console.log(test.toString()); 
// name: Batman
// secretIdentity: Bruce Wayne
// revealIdentity: function ()
```

##JS Doubly Linked List

###Approach
With all the previous work in both lists and javascript, this assignment wasnt too bad. I decided to try out Mocha and Chai which took a while.
